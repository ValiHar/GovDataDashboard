      <a href="GovData.de">GovData.de</a> is the data portal for Germany which intends to give the federal, state and
      local governments a platfrom to share their data.
      Although the "Open Data Act" makes it obligatory to share data, only about 52,000 data sets are online so
      far. This dashboard showcases the numbers of datasets that the individual federal ministries have shared via the
      public data portal so far.

            To filter the chart, click on the ministry names in the legend. This will hide/show the clicked ministry in
            the diagram. You can also select/deselect all ministries or invert the diagram with the buttons on the left
            side of the legend.

            Hovering over the name of a ministry shows a tooltip that displays the precise number of datasets the
            ministry shared, as well as its percentage relative to all currently displayed ministries.

            The bar chart below provides another method to explore the distribution of published datasets over the german federal ministries. In the bar chart the ministries are sorted by the amount of datasets they've shared, as in the nightingale chart.

            However, the bar chart enables you to easily compare a ministry to its neighbors, by zooming into the diagram with the mouse wheel. Hovering over the bar of a ministry again shows a tooltip with specific information about the ministry.
